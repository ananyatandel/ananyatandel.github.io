            <h2>Ananya Tandel</h2>
              <p>Welcome to my personal website! My name is Ananya (pronounced uh-nuhn yuh) and my pronouns are she/her/hers. I am an Undergraduate Sophomore at University of Colorado Boulder (also known as CU Boulder) pursuing a B.S. in Creative Technology & Design and minoring in Computer Science and Business.
                At CU Boulder, I am the Co-Events Chair for South Asian Student Association (SASA), a Journey Leader, an Intramural Badminton Player, and a member of CU Women In Computing.
                This website takes you through my <a href="https://ananyatandel.github.io/portfolio.html">projects</a>, <a href="https://ananyatandel.github.io/resume.html">résumé</a>, and <a href="https://ananyatandel.github.io/contact.html">contact information</a>!
                This was initially created as a midterm project for my Web course at CU Boulder. My main goals for this class are to enhance my web development skills and make websites visually pleasing and functional for everyone.
                A little bit more about me: In my free time, you can find me at the courts playing tennis or badminton; I consider myself an avid reader, traveler, and concert enthusiast!</p>
